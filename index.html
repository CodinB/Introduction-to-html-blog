        My name is Briun, and I am originally from Virginia, USA. I have lived in a variety of places, including California, Hawaii, Ohio, and China. I have always loved foreign language, and I have been learning <strong>Chinese</strong> for over 12 years. I am now learning web development, and I will work to become as fluent in development languages as spoken language.
